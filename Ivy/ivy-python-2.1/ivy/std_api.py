"""
Implements the standard Ivy API.

You can refer to the example code ``pyhello.py`` for an example of use.

All methods in this module are frontends to a `ivy.IvyServer` instance, stored
in the module's attributes `_IvyServer`.

:group Connecting to/disconnecting from the Ivy bus:
  IvyInit, IvyStart,IvyMainLoop, IvyStop
:group Bindings: IvyBindMsg, IvyUnBindMsg, IvyBindDirectMsg
:group Inspecting the Ivy bus:
  IvyGetApplicationList, IvyGetApplication, IvyGetApplicationName,
  IvyGetApplicationHost
:group Interacting with other Ivy clients:
  IvySendMsg, IvySendDieMsg, IvySendDirectMsg
:group Timers: IvyTimerRepeatAfter, IvyTimerModify, IvyTimerRemove
